# Get Outta Here

Get Outta Here is a Google Chrome extension to manage your time spent on unproductive websites. 

Whenever the extension detects that the current website is in your list of unproductive websites, it triggers the timer. When the time is up, the extension will alert you when the time is up and it will automatically close the tab that you are currently on. Timer will still run even if page refreshes or you enter another website that is in your list.

## Features
    - Add/Delete websites to list of unproductive websites
    - Clear all websites from the list
    - Choose duration of timer
    - Choose to close the active tab after time is up or not

I decided against having an on/off button because I don't want to be tempted to turn it off. The only way to turn it off is by typing "chrome://extensions" onto the search bar and turning off the extension there. Hopefully, this extra barrier deters users from turning it off on a whim.
